RealmeXT,Rana Sarkar,5,Best in the market!,excellent smart phone to purchase. awasome camera and display. need to improve battery. overall worth every penny.
RealmeXT,PRALAY JANA,5,Super!,Best in the market in it's price segment. classy design: super AMOLED display makes this phone standing out of the crowd.

RealmeXT,Rishika Madheswaran,5,Just wow!,first i thought this phone is simply awesome but after using three days i found some issues like while watching movie the other app notification sound is too loud. we cannot adjust the notification sound. only three settings available -- media volume: ring volume and alarm volume. notification sound is based on media volume. so now i am keeping my mobile on vibrate mode and then watching movie. while listening songs and watching movie the notification sound will be there for 3-4 seconds and o...
